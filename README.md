### Hi there 👋 I'm Genesis De La Cruz Escobar 🙂
😄 Pronouns: She/Her

💬 I'm a data enthusiast. My journey began in tech sales, where I honed my research and analytical skills by identifying customer needs, analyzing market trends, and exceeding sales quotas through data-driven insights. While my experience spans various industries, from legal services to Tech Sales, my true passion lies in deciphering the stories hidden within data.
This passion led me to pursue a Data Analyst Bootcamp Certification. Beyond technical skills like EXCEL, SQL Server, MySQL, Python, Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, and experience with Sharepoint, I possess strong analytical thinking, communication, and problem-solving abilities honed through managing databases, generating reports, CRM dashboards, and building effective sales pipelines.

🤓 I'm excited to continue this self-learning journey and ready to dive into the next learning adventure. If you are on a similar journey or want to connect, please feel free to reach out. I love to connect!
